Research topic: "Using Combined RSP and HSRL-2 Measurements to Estimate Cloud Droplet Number Concentration"

This repository includes sample work from working as a Research Intern at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies during Summer 2020.

File summary:

falcon_2260nm_band.m - Analyzes a given flight (Februrary 27th, 2020) for a specific bandwidth (2260nm) for the NASA HU-25 Falcon.

Nd_Intern_Presentation_Final.pdf - PDF of my final presentation for the summer. Includes: 1. Droplet Concentration Review 2. Methods Overview 3. Instruments 4. ACTIVATE Campaign 5. Results 6. Discussion & Conclusions 7. Future Work.

Quicklooks.m - Brief plotting script to get an overview sense (a "quick look") of the water droplet statistics for a given section of a flight for NASA King Air B200 flights.

falcon_quicklooks.m - Similar to the above quicklooks file, but for NASA HU-25 Falcon flights.

longmaster.m - Combines HSLR and RSP data for all dates of interest.
